# Standards for this repository

These rules apply to every task. How the project is built is described in
ARCHITECTURE.md: read it before creating or moving files, adding a dependency,
or changing anything in `docker/`, and keep it true when you change the design.

## Boundaries (these override everything else)

- NOTHING is installed on the host. No packages, tools, libraries, language
  runtimes or global configuration, by any means. If you believe a host
  install is truly unavoidable, stop, explain why no container-based
  alternative works, and wait for my explicit approval of that specific
  install. Expect the answer to be no.
- Every change on the host happens inside this repository. Nothing is written
  outside this directory tree. An agent's own memory or global instruction
  file is the only possible exception, and only when I have agreed.
- Powerful commands (docker, gh, curl, wget, and their like) run only inside
  Makefile targets. Never run them as one-off commands, and never tuck them
  inside a longer command or script. Anything run more than once (testing,
  validation, a data step) belongs in the Makefile; if a task needs a new
  command, add a target and say so.
- Secrets live in `.env`, which is gitignored; commit a `.env.example`.

## Git

- A new repository starts with one commit on `main`, made by me: at least a
  README. Branch from it.
- Work on your feature branch. Commit to it often, in small steps, each with a
  clear message. You may push it.
- `main` changes only through a pull request that I review and merge. Never
  commit to, merge into, or push to `main`.
- Merging into any branch other than your feature branch needs my explicit
  approval, every time. Approval for one merge is not approval for the next.
- Never force-push, rewrite published history, or change git configuration.

## Before you start

For any task that creates or changes more than one file, reply first with your
plan and the files you will touch, in under 40 lines, followed by your
assumptions and your questions. Wait for approval.

## Invariants (true after every change)

- Results are computed by the backend and delivered through the API. The
  frontend draws and handles interaction; it computes nothing a scientist
  would call a result (a fit, a unit conversion, a filter, a statistic).
- Everything the app needs is installed when the image is built, never while
  it runs.
- The app is published on `127.0.0.1` only.

## Running anything

Through the Makefile, and nothing else. `make help` lists the targets;
`make verify` is the gate.

## Quality

Follow current best practice for code quality, structure and security, and say
in the plan where you depart from it and why. Code a stranger can read, with
type hints and docstrings on anything public. Every input validated at the API
boundary, errors handled and never swallowed. No secrets in code, logs or
error messages, no `eval`, no shell built from user input. Add a dependency
only when it earns its place, and say why.

## Done means

- `make verify` is green from a fresh clone.
- Each pipeline has a test that fails when the result is wrong; show it
  failing once before you make it pass.
- The README is enough for a stranger, and ARCHITECTURE.md still describes the
  project.
- Say what you did not verify.
